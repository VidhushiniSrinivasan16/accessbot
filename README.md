# Accessibility-check bot

Accessibility-check Chatbot have 2 main functions, the first one is to organize a coordinated crowdsourcing effort to map restaurant, store , offices, etc.  It basically shoot  a quick set of questions like "Do you see a ramp?", "Can you ask for a Braile menu?" , "Is the bathroom in the first floor?", etc.  All these questions are based on Americanâ€™s with Disability Act (ADA) and Open travel alliance (OTA).  

The second functionality of this bot is to inform the general public about the accessibility based on their location. A mechanism will be included to catch unanswered queries, save them in a database and add them to the crowdsource queue.
